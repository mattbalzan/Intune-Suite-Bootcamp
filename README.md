> Challenges Customers Face Today

  - Remote/hybrid staff â†’ Without VPN, IT canâ€™t easily help users.

  - Shadow IT tools â†’ Apps like TeamViewer/AnyDesk bypass company controls, creating compliance risks.

  - Lack of audit logs â†’ With Quick Assist or similar, thereâ€™s no record of what support staff did.

  - App packaging overhead â†’ IT spends hours/months packaging MSI/EXE apps.

  - Security risk â†’ Unpatched 3rd-party apps are a top entry point for attackers.
<br>

> Remote Help: What It Is

  - Cloud-based tool â†’ Runs natively within Intune/Entra, no VPN needed.

  - Identity-first â†’ Requires Entra ID login and MFA before session starts.

  - Session modes â†’ IT can view only, or take full control if allowed.

  - Audited logs â†’ Every action is tracked in Intune for compliance.
<br>

  - Replace 3rd-party apps â†’ Removes need for unapproved screen-sharing software.
  
  - Auditability â†’ Regulators/auditors can see a full trail of support sessions.
